As a user,
I want the system to calculate the new interest,
So that I don't have to do it myself.

Pass in the balance, interest rate (amount & basis age).
Get back the interest amount and new total.

As a user,
I want the system to calculate the match amount (and total),
So that I don't have to do it myself.

Pass in:
- the current balance
- the total amount of any additions that happened since the last checkpoint
- the match settings (minimum, rate, granularity, limit)
Return the match amount and new total.

As a user,
I want a UI for doing interest calculations,
So that I can actually tell the computer what calculation I want.


input form:
	balance
	age
	amount per age
	submit
output
	interest
	new balance

use the same URL as the JSON

make it AJAX
